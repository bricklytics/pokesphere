# Pok√©Sphere
Welcome to the **Pokesphere**, built with modern Android development tools, following best practices for architecture, dependency injection and UI design with Jetpack Compose.
Pokesphere is a project built by Julio Martins as a showcase of abilities in android software development. 
It still have room for improvements and I will adopt new technologies or apply any code refinement to improve performance, maintainability and design.


## üöÄ Features
- **Modern UI:** Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- **Clean Architecture:** Modular design for scalability
- **Reactive Programming:** Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Room for local database, Retrofit & OkHttp for networking
- **Dependency Injection:** Dagger Hilt
- **Media:** Glide for image loading
- **Custom Icons:** FontAwesome Compose integration
