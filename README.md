# Pok√©Sphere
Welcome to a modern Android application crafted using cutting-edge development tools and adhering to industry best practices in architecture, dependency injection, and UI design with Jetpack Compose.
Developed entirely in Kotlin, with Jetpack Compose as the core UI framework, this app take advantage of [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), a comprehensive REST API filled with data about the Pok√©mon universe.
Created by Julio Martins as a demonstration of expertise in Android mobile software development, Pokesphere is an example of clean architecture and efficient coding practices. While the app is fully functional, there is always room for enhancement. I am committed to integrating new technologies and refining the codebase to further improve performance, maintainability, and design
